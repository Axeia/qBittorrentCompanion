# Search plugin folder
This folder will contain all installed search plugins for qBittorrent Companion. 
A plugin is a python script (file with .py extension) and should accept a search argument and return a list of results.

This is the same system as qBittorrent itself uses and plugins should be cross-compatible.

## Where to find search plugins
qBittorrent search plugin contributors maintain a list on the qBittorrent wiki: 
https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins

>[!Note]
> You can find the same plugins within qBittorrent Companion's built-in search plugin manager (see below).

## Search plugin manager
qBittorrent Companion has its own built-in search plugin manager that parses the previously mentioned wiki and lists all the available plugins. Just click the download button and it will download it to this very folder (triggering the auto recognition).

The search plugin manager can be accessed by clicking the icon to the right of the "Search" heading under the Search tab.
