# Search Plugins
qBittorrent Companion uses the same setup as qBittorrent itself so plugins that work for it should for qBittorrent Companion as well.

## Files
This folder contains an engines folder that contains the search engine plugins for qBittorrent Companion.
You can find more of them on the qbittorrent [official](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/tree/master/nova3/engines) and [unofficial](https://github.com/qbittorrent/search-plugins/wiki/Unofficial-search-plugins) search plugin github pages.
Simply place the `.py` files in the `engines` folder and they will be available in the search tab of qBittorrent Companion after a quick restart.

### Other py files
The `engines` folder also contains some other `.py` files that contain functionality to be used by the search plugins.
These are the exact same files as the ones you can find on the [qBittorrent github page](https://github.com/qbittorrent/qBittorrent/tree/master/src/searchengine/nova3).
